Simple Blog Website using Node.js and SQL

This project is a full-stack blog website built using Node.js and SQL. The website allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

Key Features:

	•	Data Storage: Blog posts are stored in an SQL database, with tables for posts, users, and comments.
	•	CRUD Operations: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.
	•	User Management: Basic authentication and user management for creating and managing accounts.
	•	Dynamic Content: Blog content is dynamically fetched from the SQL database, allowing for real-time updates.
	•	RESTful API: The backend is built with a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests and communicate with the SQL database.
	•	Database: SQL is used for storing data with structured tables and relationships between posts, comments, and users.
